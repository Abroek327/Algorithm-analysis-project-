#TODO: Need to design and Implement simple, clean, dynamic, colorful, interactive, web-based, easilly accessable with an internet connection, UI
#TODO: UI should have live parlay tracker feature with good visual design that tracks the state of each leg of a parlay (W,L, Yet To Start, Ongoing)
#If leg is a 'Win' that leg should light up green
#If leg is a 'Loss" whole parlay should light up red
#If All legs in parlay are a 'Win' then whole parlay should turn gold
#While Parlay has legs in either the 'Yet to start' or 'Ongoing' states, it should give a live percentage chance of that parlay hitting
#While Parlay grouping has parlays with legs in either the 'Yet to start' or 'Ongoing' states, it should give a live 'Max potential Win' and a percentage chance of it happening, it should also give a 'Most likely potential win' and a percentage chance of that happening as well
#TODO: UI should have a 'test and learn' tab where a user can enter a user made custom parlay and the algorithm will give it a score out of 10 on how good it is, as well as othr addition stats used for evaluating our own parlays
#TODO: UI should have option to generate 'Best Bet of the day' where it generates the most optimal parlay of games that are being played that day
#TODO: Computer Generate Additional SQL Database that contains 'Theoretical Games' where win percentages and odds are randomly generated, and outcomes are randomly generated based on those win percentages, for aditional testing
#TODO: Complete SQL database of NFL games up until current (Past games are subject to different rule changes and a different style of play, but still useful)
#TODO: Create SQL Database of stats for 'average parlay bettors' as well as 'Pro parlay bettors' to compare against algorithm for effectiveness
#TODO: UI should present user with three different options for parlay groupings to choose from: (High Profit/High Risk), (Optimal), (Lowest Risk)
#High and low risk options should still be relatively optimal
#TODO: Create a linear regression model to test if most profitable parlay groupings will always be profitable in a wide variety of contexts
#Stats for bettors could include (Profitable bet percentage), (Average amount of profit), as well as all stats we use to evaluate our own parlays and parlay groupings
#UI should have click and scrollable 'Input' from a list of web-scraped, upcoming games and bets to save user from wasting time entering data manually
#TODO: Need to implement web scraper to feed live/soon games to UI for easy user selection by click
#TODO:Need to be able to work with 'correlated parlays' as well, and their boosted odds (Ex: Patriots Win + Tom Brady Scores 2 Touchdowns + Patriots Defence allows less than 10 points)
#A decent amount of online betting services do not allow correlated parlays, so there needs to be an option to have the program aviod corredlated parlays as well
#User would have to indicate which bets are directly correlated and give a guess at how correlated they are
#It would be better to avoid additional user input for correlation strength, we could use web scraping to find bets then calculate correlation ourselves using mathematical means
#TODO: Need to create object to hold possible groupings of best parlays, should have the following attributes for later analysis: (Average number of legs in each parlay), (String Factor), (Number of parlays), (Total Value), (Max Profit Possible), (Average Profit Possible), (Percent Chance of profit occuring at all), 
#TODO: Program should calculate how many parlays would be optimal to use in final grouping, instead of asking for user input
# An Idea for that is to use simulated annueling again on possible sets of best parlays looking to maximize "Total Value" (refrencing 'value' attribute of configuration obj), we should also consider a historical factor when calculating "Total Value" so that backtesting with SQL database can be
#TODO: Each configuration group needs to keep track of its 'string factor'
#String factor refers to when one instance of a team winning is included in multiple configurations
#By the nature of parlays, including the same pick in multiple configurations in the same grouping would make it liable for the entire grouping to fail with a single unexpected loss
#Therefore a high "String Factor" would increase the total risk for the grouping, but shouldn't neccicarily be a dealbreaker if stringing a pick adequately improves total profit possibility
